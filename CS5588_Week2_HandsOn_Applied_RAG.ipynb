Simultaneously, it leverages the vector component to catch \"concept-seeking\" queries where users describe issues in natural language, such as \"screen is blank,\" even if the relevant ticket only mentions \"display troubleshooting.\" By giving equal weight to both literal accuracy and semantic intent, the system maximizes recall without sacrificing the precision needed for technical reliability.

For U2 (High-Stakes) scenarios, such as resetting a firewall or handling sensitive account data, citations provide a direct link to the source ticket or manual. This allows the analyst to perform \"human-in-the-loop\" verification, ensuring they aren't blindly following an AI suggestion for a high-risk operation.

Instead of \"hallucinating\" a generic answer or providing a low-confidence guess that could lead to a catastrophic error, the system simply admits it doesn't know. This prevents the specific failure of overconfidence, where a system provides a wrong answer that looks right. For an analyst, a system that says \"I cannot find a confident match for this error\" is far more trustworthy than one that consistently provides irrelevant or incorrect advice."

        "## Product Overview\n",
        "- Product name: Support Analyst Assistant\n",
        "- Target users: Support Analyst\n",
        "- Core problem: Navigating high-volume ticket data (26,000+ entries) to find accurate technical solutions and compliance-critical information.\n",
        "- Why RAG: LLMs lack the specific, up-to-the-minute internal ticket history and legal guidelines required to solve niche support issues without hallucinating.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Reality\n",
        "- Source / owner: Bitext (Customer Support LLM Training Dataset).\n",
        "- Sensitivity: Contains simulated PII and internal business logic (Standard Operating Procedures).\n",
        "- Document types: Structured .txt files containing User Intent, Instruction, and Official Response.\n",
        "- Expected scale in production: ~26,000–50,000 documents across various categories (Account, Technical, Billing).\n",
        "\n",
        "## User Stories + Rubric\n",
        "- U1: As an agent, I want to quickly retrieve the specific return policy for a damaged item so I can provide immediate answers.\n",
        "- U2: As a Compliance Officer, I want to verify if a refund is permitted in specific jurisdictions to avoid violating export laws.\n",
        "- U3: As a Senior Analyst, I want the system to flag \"Unresolved\" when internal manuals contain conflicting instructions.\n",
        "(Rubric: acceptable evidence + correct answer criteria)\n",
        "\n",
        "## System Architecture\n",
        "- Chunking: Semantic (paragraph-based) to preserve the integrity of the \"Official Response\" blocks.\n",
        "- Keyword retrieval: BM25Okapi for exact matches of error codes and ticket IDs.\n",
        "- Vector retrieval: FAISS + all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for semantic intent and synonym matching\n",
        "- Hybrid α: 0.5 (Balanced) to ensure both technical codes and natural language queries are captured.\n",
        "- Reranking governance: Cross-Encoder (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2) used as a safety gate to validate context relevance before generation.\n",
        "- LLM / generation option: Grounded \"Evidence Summary\" mode (simulated RAG) to prevent unverified generation.\n",

        "- Failure: The system failed to differentiate between a general refund ticket and a legal jurisdiction constraint (U2).\n",
        "- Layer: Retrieval / Data Layer.\n",
        "- Consequence: An agent could unknowingly approve a refund that violates international export laws based on irrelevant \"similar\" tickets.\n",
        "- Safeguard / next fix: Implement Metadata Filtering. Assign a \"Geographic/Legal\" tag to documents and update the retriever to filter by these tags when keywords like \"jurisdiction\" are detected.\n",
